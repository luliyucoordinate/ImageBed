其实我觉得这是一个很深刻的问题，到底什么是空？佛说：“空即是色，色即是空”。那么c++中什么是空？0到底是什么？

- The curious =0 syntax was chosen over the obvious alternative of introducing a new keyword pure or abstract because at the time I saw no chance of getting a new keyword accepted. Had I suggested pure, Release 2.0 would have shipped without abstract classes. Given a choice between a nicer syntax and abstract classes, I chose abstract classes. Rather than risking delay and incurring the certain fights over pure, I used the tradition C and C++ convention of using 0 to represent "not there." The =0 syntax fits with my view that a function body is the initializer for a function also with the (simplistic, but usually adequate) view of the set of virtual functions being implemented as a vector of function pointers.

以上是Bjarne的`The Design and Evolution of C++`中的一段话。

- A second alternative solution would be to accept (void\*)0 as a “magic” pointer value with roughly the semantics of the nullptr proposed in section 2.
  However, this solution has serious problems:
  ​    It would still be necessary for programmers to use the macro NULL to name the null pointer (the notation (void\*)0 is just too ugly).
  ​    Furthermore, (void\*)0 would have to have a unique semantics; that is, its type would not be void\*. We do not consider opening the C type hole by allowing any value of type void\* to any T\*.
  The introduction of nullptr as proposed in section 2 is a far cleaner solution.
