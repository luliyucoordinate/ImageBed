**Description**  
A word is a string of lowercases. A word pattern is a string of lowercases, '?'s and '\*'s. In a pattern, a '?' matches any single lowercase, and a '\*' matches none or more lowercases.   
There are many word patterns and some words in your hand. For each word, your task is to tell which patterns match it.   
**Input**  
The first line of input contains two integers N (0 < N <= 100000) and M (0 < M <=100), representing the number of word patterns and the number of words. Each of the following N lines contains a word pattern, assuming all the patterns are numbered from 0 to N-1. After those, each of the last M lines contains a word.   
You can assume that the length of patterns will not exceed 6, and the length of words will not exceed 20.   
**Output**  
For each word, print a line contains the numbers of matched patterns by increasing order. Each number is followed by a single blank. If there is no pattern that can match the word, print "Not match".
